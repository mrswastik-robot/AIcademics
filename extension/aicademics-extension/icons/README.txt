These are placeholder files for icons. You'll need to replace them with actual icon images.

Icon Placeholder

This directory needs the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You should replace these placeholder instructions with actual icon files that match the AIcademics brand styling. The recommended icon format is PNG with transparency.

Suggested icon design:
- Use the AIcademics color scheme (#A17BE0 purple as primary color)
- Include a recognizable symbol that represents knowledge saving (e.g., a brain, bookmark, or document)
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility in browser toolbars
