# Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
The dashboard allows users to view, search, and manage their saved content from the Chrome extension. It integrates with the backend APIs to provide a seamless experience for knowledge management.

## Key Components

### Main Dashboard Page
- Displays a tabbed interface for accessing different views
- Provides authentication protection to ensure only logged-in users can access
- Located at `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

### Saved Content List
- Shows a paginated list of all saved content
- Provides filtering capabilities
- Includes delete functionality
- Uses mock data when database is unavailable
- Located at `src/components/SavedContentList.tsx`

### Search Knowledge Base
- Implements search interface with mock results for development
- Provides both content results and AI-generated answers
- Will integrate with vector search when backend is ready
- Located at `src/components/SearchKnowledgeBase.tsx`

## Development Approach
To ensure a smooth development experience while database integration is in progress:

### Mock Data Implementation
- Added realistic mock data for saved content and search results
- Implemented graceful fallbacks when database connections fail
- Added informative UI elements to indicate when mock data is being used

### Client/Server Separation
- Dashboard is implemented as a server component for authentication
- UI components are client components with "use client" directive
- Prevents server-only code from running on the client side

### Error Handling
- Added robust error handling for API requests
- Implemented fallbacks to mock data when errors occur
- Displays user-friendly error messages

## API Endpoints
- `/api/saved-content` - Retrieves paginated saved content
- `/api/content/search` - Will implement vector search and RAG
- `/api/content/delete` - Handles deletion of content
- `/api/content/embed` - Will manage content embedding generation

## Data Models
The dashboard interacts with the following database models:
- `SavedContent` - Stores main content information
- `ContentEmbedding` - Will store vector embeddings for search
- `ContentChunk` - Will store content chunks for more granular search

## Current Status
- Basic viewing and filtering UI implemented
- Mock data implemented for development
- Database connection issues need to be resolved
- Vector search functionality not yet implemented

## Next Steps
- Fix database connection issues
- Implement vector database integration
- Create detailed view page for individual content items
- Add advanced filtering options

## Authentication
The dashboard uses NextAuth for authentication, ensuring that only logged-in users can access their content. The extension communicates with the same authentication system to maintain a unified session.
