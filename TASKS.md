# AIcademics Extension Project

## Project Overview
Enhance the existing AIcademics platform by adding a Chrome extension integration that allows users to save content from around the web to their knowledge base. This content will be accessible through the main web application, where users can query it using natural language.

## Current Progress

### Current Stage: Phase 3 - Dashboard Integration & Database Setup
We have completed the initial setup of the extension project (Phase 1), implemented the content processing capabilities (Phase 2), and created the dashboard UI (Phase 3). We are now working on the database integration and embedding system setup.
