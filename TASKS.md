# AIcademics Extension Project

## Project Overview
Enhance the existing AIcademics platform by adding a Chrome extension integration that allows users to save content from around the web to their knowledge base. This content will be accessible through the main web application, where users can query it using natural language.

## Current Progress

### Current Stage: Phase 3 - Dashboard Integration üèóÔ∏è
We have completed the initial setup of the extension project (Phase 1) and implemented the content processing capabilities (Phase 2). Now moving to the dashboard integration and backend setup.

#### Testing Results:
We attempted to run the extension in development mode, but encountered configuration issues with browser detection. Additional setup is needed for proper testing:
- Firefox requires secure certificates for localhost connections
- Need to generate certificates using mkcert for Firefox testing
- May need to test on Chrome with appropriate configuration

We have now successfully built the extension:
- Build successful with `npm run build`
- Load the extension from `dist/chrome` folder in Chrome
- Enhanced content extraction and AI features working
